			<div class = "title">Who am I?</div>
			<p>My name is Joshua Diaddigo, and I am a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the College of Computing and the Senior Web Developer for Pioneer Magazine.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">What do I do?</div>
			<p>I create. Over the past six years I have spent the majority of my time studying 3D animation, visual effects, photography and web development. I see computer science as yet another outlet full of opportunities for creativity and innovation. Languages that I am very comfortable with include Python, Java, and jQuery. However, I have utilized many different languages depending on their capabilities and my needs.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">What experience do I have?</div>
			<p>Just after my sixteenth birthday I was hired at PeachMac, Forsyth where I became possibly the youngest Certified Apple Product Professional in the world at the time. There I gained a greater understanding of technology specifically as it relates to people as I sold Apple solutions and led hundreds of training sessions ranging in volume from one person to groups of 15. This gave me a greater appreciation for intuitive software as I witnessed first hand each customer's misunderstandings and concerns while learning to use their computers. This past Summer, I interned with Tipping Point Gaming where I personally took charge of the development of a game that will soon be distributed to 40% of the casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am now a full time Computer Science student at Georgia Tech where, in addition to my course load, I am a teaching assistant for the College of Computing and the Senior Web Developer at Pioneer Magazine. Between these two positions I teach a group of 50+ students each week, lead a team of web developers in the creation of a new site (not currently live), grade homework, write course content, hold office hours, and try to tell a funny joke every now and then.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">What are my goals?</div>
			<p>I am currently looking for an opportunity to expand my experience in the field of Computer Science through an internship or co-op. The nature of the work is not incredibly important as long as creativity and problem-solving are involved.</p>
