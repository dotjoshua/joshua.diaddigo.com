			<p>My name is Joshua Diaddigo, and I am a junior at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My major is Computer Science and I love it.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">what do i do?</div>
			<p>I generally spend my time creating things. Nothing gets me more excited than turning an idea into a reality. (You can see what I've been up to recently on my <a href = "#projects">projects page</a>.) In addition to my personal technological endeavors, I have also been a Teaching Assistant or Tutor for the College of Computing at Georgia Tech since my freshman year. I currently tutor for technical interviewing and Georgia Tech's computer organization and programming course (CS 2110).</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">what experience do i have?</div>
			<p>I got my first computer when I was 12 years old and immediately fell in love with it. I picked up web design shortly thereafter, and by my sixteenth birthday I was hired by PeachMac (now <a href = "http://simplymac.com">Simply Mac</a>) where I became what was likely the youngest certified Apple Product Professional in the world. In the Summer of 2014, I interned with Tipping Point Gaming where I personally took charge of the development of a game that will soon be distributed to 40% of the casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada. I'll be spending this Summer in Chicago with <a href = "https://www.kcura.com">kCura</a> as a software engineering intern. That's the highlight reel, but you can definitely check out my <a href = "#resume">resume</a> for a more in depth timeline, or <a href = "#contact">contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">what are my goals?</div>
			<p>I would love to own my own company and be best friends with Taylor Swift, but I would settle for a really cool internship.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class = "title">do i ever wear cargo shorts?</div>
			<p>No.</p>

			<div class = "projectTitle">Crunchy Munchy</div>
			<div class = "projectBody" id = "crunchyMunchy">Crunchy Munchy is a server I configured that hosts all of my personal data (virtual machines, media and archives). I've also built a secure outward facing upload page to allow others to send me files quickly and efficiently (<a href = "http://jsh.cm/">jsh.cm</a>). One of the challenges with Crunchy Munchy is that it resides on a dynamic IP address. My solution for this was to build an app which keeps track of the latest location of the server and simplifies the connection process. When I have an unusual amount of downtime, I tweak my Twitter bot that is powered by Crunchy Munchy.</div>

I can also send him photos and he'll send me a corresponding link. Referring to my servers as people is one of the nerdier things I do.</div>
